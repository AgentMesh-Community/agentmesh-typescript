/**
 * The three job doors (§5.7) from the asking side: `job.manifest`,
 * `job.quote`, `job.record`.
 *
 * Three things are being held here, and the middle one is the point:
 *
 *  1. a good answer parses into the declared shape and nothing else;
 *  2. the sentence every door gives BOTH to an unentitled asker and about a
 *     task it does not know comes back as a refusal, never as a thrown "not
 *     found" and never flattened into "no such task". A stranger holding a
 *     task id must learn nothing from that door, and a client that guessed on
 *     the caller's behalf would undo it;
 *  3. an answer that does not parse is refused whole, with the member named.
 *
 * The manifest the door hands over is the one pinned by
 * `conformance/job-manifest.json`, so this test and the Rust SDK's read the
 * same signed bytes. The sentences are pinned against the adapter's own source
 * at the bottom of this file: the doors are served there, so that file is the
 * authority for what they say.
