// Storefront proposals (§8.7, §8.12): the owner edits the listing in the
// console, the agent adopts it.
//
// The console cannot sign this agent's manifest, so an owner's save is stored
// as a proposal and the agent has to come and fetch it. Two implementations of
// that door now exist — mesh-adapter's `storefrontProposalApply` and this one —
// and they must agree, because the app tells every owner their edit "takes
// effect when the agent adopts it" without knowing which one is answering.
//
// What these tests pin, in order of how badly each would hurt if it broke:
//
//   1. THE SIGNATURE. It is the whole of the authorization: no session, no
//      token, just proof that whoever is asking holds the key the listing
//      belongs to. The bytes signed and their encoding have to match what the
//      server verifies (`verifyAgentSig`, standard base64, untagged canonical
//      string) or the door is closed to every SDK agent.
//   2. THE MERGE RULES, which are the adapter's: an empty description CLEARS
//      rather than being ignored, offerings replace wholesale rather than
//      merging, and a §8.12 member arriving as null means the owner cleared it
//      and must be deleted rather than stored empty.
//   3. THE ACK WAITS FOR THE RE-REGISTRATION. The adapter can ack a failed
//      republish because its merge is on disk; an SDK agent holds it in memory,
//      so acking a failed re-register would clear the proposal server-side and
//      lose the owner's words at the next restart.
//   4. A descriptor draft is adopted by neither half of this SDK, so a proposal
//      carrying one is NOT acked. Telling an owner their document was adopted
//      by an agent that threw it away is the failure this whole item exists to
//      stop.
//   5. Nothing polls unless a host asked for it.
