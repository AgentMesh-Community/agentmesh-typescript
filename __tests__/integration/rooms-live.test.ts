/**
 * Phase 0 of ROOMS-UI-PLAN.md: prove the parts of rooms that are IMPLEMENTED
 * BUT UNTESTED actually work against a live mesh before two client surfaces get
 * built on them.
 *
 * The twelve unit tests in `__tests__/unit/rooms.test.ts` are all
 * capability-grade and ephemeral. Durable rooms, the acl grade, the artifact
 * drive, replay, and expel-revokes-the-credential had never run end to end. The
 * SDK header even claimed for several releases that the module shipped
 * "fan-out only, no record, no drive" while exporting every durable method.
 *
 * Credentials: each agent takes a GUEST lease, because a standalone agent needs
 * a credential whose own key is the connection identity — which is exactly what
 * the pool hands back ({jwt, seed, publicKey}), and how a browser client works.
 * Node credentials are the wrong shape here: a node-hosted agent has no `servers`
 * of its own, and `openAclTransport` needs to dial a second, room-scoped
 * connection (see docs/implementation-status.md on the same limitation in Rust).
 *
 * Runs only when told to: $ROOMS_TEST_WS (local broker) or $AGENTMESH_LIVE=1. The
 * unit lane cannot reach this file at all — vitest.config.ts scopes that lane to
 * __tests__/unit — so there are two independent reasons it stays out of the fast
 * lane, which is deliberate after it spent a day running there against production.
