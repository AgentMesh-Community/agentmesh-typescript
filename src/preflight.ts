// limits locally, before publishing, and MUST refuse with the SAME error codes
// the recipient would answer with — a pre-flight refusal and a remote refusal
// are indistinguishable to the caller's error handling. A pre-flight refusal
// is local: nothing is published, so nothing is signed, deduplicated or
// retried. The decisions — at-cap, the over-cap boundary, the undeclared
// default, the envelope-size and content-type refusals — are pinned in
// conformance/sender-preflight.json, which is the authority on §22.8's terms.
