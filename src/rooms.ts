/**
 * Rooms (mesh://extensions/rooms/v1) — shared conversations for N agents.
 *
 * All three privacy grades and both the record and the drive are implemented
 * here: `open`/`join` for ephemeral capability rooms (fan-out only, CAP-1),
 * `openDurable` for a replayable record (CAP-2, `history`/`fullHistory`),
 * `openAcl`/`joinAcl` for broker-enforced membership on a room-scoped
 * credential, and `attach`/`fetchArtifact` for the drive (CAP-3). Sealed rooms
 * encrypt `say` bodies and artifact bytes under a room key that never leaves
 * a member's process.
 *
 * (This header long claimed the module shipped "the ephemeral slice — fan-out
 * only, no record, no drive" while exporting every durable method a few
 * hundred lines below. It was describing a release that had been superseded.)
 *
 * Every room message is an ordinary signed mesh envelope whose `context_id`
 * is the `room_id` and whose payload is one of the typed shapes below.
 * Authorship is per-message and non-repudiable: receivers verify each
 * envelope's signature against its `from` and drop failures.
 *
 * What stops a non-member differs by grade (EXT-5 §6): at `capability` it is
 * possession of the descriptor and nothing more; at `acl` the broker refuses
 * anyone the creator has not admitted; at `sealed` it is possession of the
 * room key, so the transport and any storage hold only ciphertext.

 * The room's PLAN: how it means to work, named rather than described
 * (EXT-5 §8.5).
 *
 * Governance is not the rooms extension's job — who may speak when, how a
 * draft is judged, who holds the pen — and the extension says so. What a
 * room CAN do is say which published pattern it is running, so every member
 * reads the same word for it instead of inferring the rules from the
 * traffic. The vocabulary is Agent Collab's (https://agentcollab.dev), and
 * `standard` names where the pattern is defined so a reader can go and look
 * rather than guess what the creator meant.
 *
 * THE PLAN, NOT THE STATE. This is the room's opening declaration and its
 * intended shape: where it starts, what it means to work through, and who
 * facilitates. Where the room actually IS lives in the record, as `phase`
 * messages the facilitator signs — because a meeting moves and a signed
 * descriptor cannot. Read the current phase from {@link Room.phase}, never
 * from here.
 *
 * (This field shipped in 0.46.0 as a single fixed `pattern` for the room's
 * whole life, which modelled a room's opening stance as if it were its
 * biography. The descriptor holds what cannot change; the record holds what
 * happened. `pattern` survives as the phase the room OPENS in.)
 *
 * DECLARED, NOT ENFORCED. Nothing in this SDK or the rooms service makes a
 * member wait its turn: the declaration is a contract the members honor, in
 * exactly the way an agent's storefront is its own word. A room that says
 * `floor` and then talks over itself has broken a promise, not a rule, and
 * a surface must not render this as a guarantee. The one pattern that does
 * have teeth today is `work-board`, because its claims are real (EXT-5 §10)
 * — and its teeth come from that machinery, not from this field.
