   *
   *   - every service subject, this one included, is wrapped in the shared
   *     rate limiter (`services/src/shared/handler.ts`), which answers over the
   *     limit with a `RATE_LIMITED` *error* envelope. An agent that had just

   *     guarded, was refused, and unsubscribed itself from the only inbox
   *     anybody was writing to;
   *   - any mesh participant that could publish into this connection's reply
   *     inbox could answer first with anything at all, which made "make that
   *     agent unreachable" a single unsigned message.
   *
   * Hence: decode (so an unsigned or forged envelope is refused), bind to the
   * request (§6.2, so a raced reply is refused), reject any `error`, and
   * require the service's explicit ok. Everything else — a timeout, no
   * responders, an undecodable reply, an error, an ack for something else —
   * means NOT guarded and the agent stays on its public inbox. The service
   * refuses by saying nothing at all (it does that for an unregistered agent
   * and at its guard ceiling), which is exactly why silence and error must land
   * in the same place.
   *
   * The accepted ack is what the admission service actually sends: a signed
   * `respond` bound to this request, carrying `payload.output.ok === true`
   * (with `guarded` true, or absent). A worse-than-useless "ack" — the benign

   * `filter_subjects` are every feed the agent follows durably. One per agent
   * and not one per feed because a credential grants a consumer only by its
   * whole name (a permission matches whole subject tokens), and the agent's

   * named per feed could only be granted as `*`, and then any agent could
   * pull another agent's deliveries. Config, pinned by SPEC and by every
   * SDK's tests: ack_policy Explicit, deliver_policy New, ack_wait 30s,
   * max_deliver 5.
   *
   * Binding: info on the consumer; when it is missing, create it with this
   * feed as its one filter; when it stands without this feed, update its
   * filters to add it. Filters are never removed here: a feed this process no
   * longer follows keeps arriving, and a delivery no handler claims is handed
   * back after FEED_UNCLAIMED_NAK_MS (so a process that subscribes several
   * feeds one after another does not lose one it has not reached yet), and
   * max_deliver ends it.
   *
   * One consume loop per process, shared by every durable feed subscription,
   * because a pull consumer splits its deliveries between whoever pulls. A
   * delivery is dispatched through the §22 pipeline (buffered freshness
   * window, per-pattern dedup) to every handler whose pattern matches its
   * subject and acked after they all return; a handler that throws leaves it
   * unacked for redelivery. Undecodable bytes are acked and dropped.
   *
   * A missing MESH_FEED stream or a refused JetStream call throws, loudly,
   * rather than degrading to a live subscription: a caller who asked for
   * durability must not silently get the weak thing. A credential minted
   * before the feed-consumer grant existed is refused here; renewing it

   * undelivered and unacked. The cursor stays where the pass left it and the

   * dispatches it: handlers re-run, answers go to senders' inboxes, and the
   * fresh process's dedup memory cannot suppress any of it because §22.2 does
   * not survive a restart. The old unbounded drain never had that, because it
   * acked every live copy as it went — so a bound alone trades a race for
   * replay-on-restart, which on a long-lived agent is the worse of the two.

   * Re-running the bounded pass keeps the cursor at the head. Each pass still
   * reads a FRESH last sequence and stops there, so the bound is not weakened;
   * what the live path already handled in this process is caught by the dedup
   * memory and merely acked rather than dispatched again; and anything the live
   * subscription missed during a reconnect gap is recovered now instead of being
   * deferred to the next restart.
   *
   * **Reconnect is the trigger that matters.** A gap in the live subscription is
   * precisely the window in which the mailbox holds a message nothing dispatched.
   * The interval is the backstop for gaps the client did not report as a
   * reconnect (a stalled consumer, a missed delivery) and, more importantly, the
   * bound on how big the tail is allowed to get — see
   * DEFAULT_MAILBOX_DRAIN_INTERVAL_MS for why that bound is the dedup memory's

   *  since the §6.4 cutover, to the SENDER's inbox (correlated by
   *  `in_reply_to`), which is itself buffered if the sender has meanwhile gone
   *  offline. Acks after dispatch: the ack is the node's
   *  "durably accepted" signal, and from then the node owns the message.
   *  Silent no-op when there is no mailbox or no JetStream permission.
   *
   *  **The drain is bounded to the backlog that existed when it bound.** The
   *  mailbox stream captures the very subject live messages arrive on, so an
   *  unbounded drain competes with the live subscription for every live
   *  message, with §22.2 dedup deciding which of the two dispatches runs.
   *  Since the §6.4 cutover the two answer the SAME destination (the sender's
   *  inbox), so the bound is no longer what keeps a waiting requester's answer
   *  from going astray; what it still buys is that live traffic is handled by
   *  the live path, promptly, instead of waiting on a drain pass that happens
   *  to be running, and that a slow pass cannot turn into an open-ended second
   *  consumer of everything the agent receives. The accept differs on purpose:
   *  the live path emits it, the drain never does (§6.4a below).
   *
   *  A drain that stops early because a JetStream call failed is a degraded
   *  start, not a dead agent: `register` has already established the live
   *  subscription, so the agent is serving either way. The same holds for a
   *  failed re-drain: it never throws to its caller (a timer tick or a reconnect
   *  callback, neither of which has anywhere to put an error) and it never
   *  disarms the triggers, so the next pass simply tries again.
   *
   *  **One pass at a time.** `offlineDrainInFlight` is raised synchronously
   *  before the first `await`, so two triggers landing in the same tick — a
   *  reconnect during a re-register, an interval tick while a slow pass is still
   *  pulling — cannot produce two passes over one durable consumer. The second
   *  one returns immediately and the next tick picks up whatever it would have

   *
   *  - The registry reaper's `__registry_probe__`: a liveness check that must
   *    stay cheap, no inbox round trip. A drained probe has no live reply
   *    subject and is answered to nobody, which is what a liveness probe of an
   *    offline agent deserves.
   *  - A request DELIVERED ON THE GUARDED INBOX SUBJECT (EXT-6 §7): the
   *    requester of record there is the admission guard relay, transport
   *    plumbing with no inbox of its own that forwards the answer to the true
   *    sender itself. Publishing to the true sender's inbox would bypass the
   *    guard's forwarding role. The distinguishing fact is the DELIVERY
   *    subject, which the message carries; nothing sniffs the payload.
   *    Deliveries on the plain inbox subject follow the inbox rule
   *    unconditionally. A guarded-captured message the mailbox DRAIN hands
   *    over has no live relay waiting, so the drained path answers to the
   *    sender's inbox as it always has, which is consistent: the guard
   *    already admitted anything that reached the stream.
   *
   * `tap` mirrors the respond onto this agent's outbox for the operator
   * surfaces, exactly where the old call sites did.
