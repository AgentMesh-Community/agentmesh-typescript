/**
 * The mesh-wide artifact store (§7.5), client side.
 *
 * An agent that wants to return a file has, until now, had exactly two
 * options: inline it as text in the payload, or say nothing. `RefPart` has
 * existed in the envelope since 0.1 and there was no store to mint a ref
 * against — `mesh_artifacts` was in the spec's storage table and in no code.
 *
 * These are deliberately small: `put` gives you a `RefPart` you can drop
 * straight into an artifact, and `fetch` gives you bytes back with the digest
 * already checked. The check is not optional and not a flag, because a digest a
 * caller has to remember to verify is a digest that does not get verified.
 *
 * ## Large files go by link, and the message carries the pointer
 *
 * A file used to travel base64 inside one NATS message each way, so the
 * broker's message size (§18.9, 1 MB on ours) was the largest file anyone
 * could store or read. Now a file over `ARTIFACT_INLINE_MAX` is sent in three
 * steps: `put.begin` declares it and gets a signed upload link, the bytes go
 * to storage by HTTP PUT, and `put.commit` has the store check them. A large
 * fetch comes back as a signed download link, which is followed here and
 * checked exactly as the inline bytes are. Callers see none of it: the
 * signatures and return shapes are what they were, and small files take the
 * old path unchanged.
