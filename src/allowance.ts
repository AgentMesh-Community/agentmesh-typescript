// The owner allowance (extensions/EXT-8-allowance.md): a signed, node-held

// to the core budget (§7.7). A budget is what you'll pay someone else; an
// allowance is what you'll let your own agent burn. It crosses no trust
// boundary, so it never rides the wire: this module is the document handling
// (shape, tagged signature, fail-closed verification), the metering arithmetic
// (floor, pinned by conformance/allowance.json), the smallest-remaining
// ceiling precedence, and the ledger. Enforcement — the admission refusal, the
// ask-owner hold, the spend report on the terminal respond — lives on
// AgentMesh, because it happens inside the inbound dispatch.
//
// A design constraint the extension anticipates: an SDK cannot see its host's
// model bill. The HOST supplies usage (`ctx.reportUsage` / `mesh.reportUsage`);
// the SDK meters it against the owner's declared cost model, enforces the
// ceilings, refuses with a price, and reports the spend.
