/**
 * The naming rule, on the sending side.
 *
 * Decided by the owner on 2026-09-25: every agent's handle follows one global
 * standard, the agent's name, a dot and its owner's email
 * (`genesis.stephen@example.com`), registered with the naming service, and an
 * agent without one sends nothing, whichever door it uses. The sender is told
 * why before anything leaves, in the words below, with the handle proposed
 * from the name the agent already has. There are no temporary names.
 *
 * The SDK enforces it for an agent that connects with `requireNamed`, which
 * `AgentMesh.connect()` turns on by default since 2026-09-27 (`false` opts out,
 * for tests only): every
 * send this agent originates (`request`, `requestStream`, `emit`,
 * `publishFeed`, `openRoom`, `joinRoom`) checks first and throws `NOT_NAMED`
 * before anything is built or signed. Registering, discovery, service calls
 * and answering a request sent TO the agent are left alone: an agent has to
 * be able to register and be named, and a handler's answer is the embedder's
 * to decide (`namingStatus()` says where the agent stands).
 *
 * The words, the handle shape and the proposals are pinned in
 * conformance/naming-gate.json, which the Rust SDK and the reference adapter
 * are held to as well.
