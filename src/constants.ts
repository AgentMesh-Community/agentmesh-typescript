// expired one (§9.7). So the vouch is not a fact an agent establishes once at
// startup — it is a lease, and an agent that stays up longer than the lease has
// to renew it. That is what the renewal loop in mesh.ts/node.ts does; these are
// its two numbers.

 *  traffic on the live path instead of on whatever drain pass is running),
 *  and a bound on its own leaves the *tail* — everything the mailbox captured
 *  after the bind — sitting on the durable consumer unacked, forever. The
 *  consumer's cursor stays where the drain left it, the tail grows for the life
 *  of the process, and the next restart binds, sees all of it as backlog, and
 *  dispatches it: handlers re-run and answers go to senders' inboxes, with a
 *  fresh process's dedup memory unable to suppress any of it (§22.2: the memory
 *  does not survive a restart). Re-running the bounded drain is what keeps the
 *  cursor at the head, and each pass reads a fresh bound so the bound is not
 *  weakened.
 *
 *  **Why 60 seconds.** The number that matters is how much traffic can pile up
 *  in the tail between two passes, because a re-drain re-delivers everything the
 *  live path already handled and relies on the dedup memory to suppress it. That
 *  memory holds `MAX_SEEN_INBOX_IDS` (5,000) `(from, id)` pairs and evicts oldest
 *  first, and the tail is by construction the *newest* traffic — so every message
 *  in a tail of 5,000 or fewer is still remembered, and the re-drain acks it
 *  without dispatching. At 60s that takes a sustained 83 inbound messages per
 *  second, for a full minute, on one agent, to break — two orders of magnitude
 *  above an agent whose handler calls a model. On the other side, a pass costs
 *  one `STREAM.INFO` plus one `CONSUMER.INFO`, and a pull only when the tail is
 *  non-empty: two JetStream round trips a minute per agent, the same cadence the
