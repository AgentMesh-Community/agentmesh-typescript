 *
 * WHAT IT COVERS, and why it is this small. The signature is load-bearing for
 * exactly one thing: key substitution when sealing (§7.3). An attacker who can
 * answer `mesh.registry.get.<id>` puts its own X25519 key in the reply and the
 * room key is sealed to it — it reads every `say` and artifact in a room it was
 * never admitted to, and neither party sees an error. What has to be authentic
 * to stop that is the BINDING between an agent id and its encryption key.
 * Nothing else in a manifest has that property.
 *
 * An earlier version of this signed a long list of agent-declared manifest
 * fields. It worked, but it made every future manifest field a compatibility
 * decision and required the TS and Rust SDKs to agree byte-for-byte forever or
 * sealing breaks silently between them. Narrow beats broad here: this claim has
 * three inputs, all with constrained charsets, and it will not grow by accident.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT COVER, deliberately:
 * - `owner`, `visibility`, `sandbox` — the registry REWRITES these server-side
 *   after the agent signs (services/src/registry/handlers/register.ts), which is
 *   why §8.3's old "sign the whole manifest" could never verify for any reader.
 * - `interaction` — §8.3a is explicit that it is not a security boundary: an
 *   agent that misdeclares itself inconveniences callers rather than gaining
 *   privilege, and a signature cannot tell an honest declaration from a lie
 *   since the agent signs whatever it says. It also already fails safe: absent
 *   or unverified reads as `interactive`, the cautious answer (§8.3a). Compare
 *   `encryption_key`, which has no safe default — you either seal to an
 *   unverified key or refuse. A v2 claim MAY cover it if tamper-evidence on the
 *   field ever earns its keep.
 * - every other descriptive field (`name`, `offerings`, `cost`, …). A forged reply
 *   can still mislead a caller about those; that is a registry-authenticity
 *   problem (assessment 2.3/6.2), solved by binding the response to the
 *   registry's key, not by widening this claim.
 *
 * A NEWLINE-JOINED STRING, not canonical JSON: JSON brings key ordering, string
 * escaping, number formatting and absent-vs-null to a claim made of three
 * strings — four ways for two SDKs to drift, for no benefit. `pan-checkin-v3`
 * already uses this shape for exactly this cross-implementation problem, and it
 * is the one canonicalization in the repo with a fixture pinning it
 * (`conformance/naming.json`). This claim gets the same treatment:
 * `conformance/manifest-signing.json`.
 *
 * The encoding is unambiguous because only the LAST field is unbounded: `id` is
 * a fixed-length nkey and `issued_at` is an RFC 3339 instant, so no two distinct
 * claims share a byte string. Components carrying a newline are refused outright
 * rather than allowed to shift the framing.
 *
 * `issued_at` is inside the signed bytes AND published as `trust.issued_at`, so
 * a verifier can rebuild exactly what was signed. An absent `encryption_key`
 * signs as the empty string — the claim then says "this agent declares no
 * encryption key", and an attacker who adds one has to break the signature.
