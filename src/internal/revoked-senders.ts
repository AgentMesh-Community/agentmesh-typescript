/**
 * Refusing a revoked sender (SPEC §5.3): "Receivers MUST refuse a message
 * signed by a revoked agent key."
 *
 * An envelope signature proves which key signed it, not that the key is still
 * its owner's. When an owner reports a key leaked, the registry marks it
 * revoked, and from then on it answers a `get` for that key with
 * `UNAUTHORIZED`, `details.reason: agent_key_revoked`. This asks that question
 * about each sender before its message is handled, with a short memo.
 *
 * FAIL SAFE, in both directions, as the plan required:
 *
 *   - a check that cannot answer (registry down, slow, no responders) does not
 *     block anyone: a known-good contact keeps working through a registry
 *     outage;
 *   - a key already seen revoked stays refused for the life of the process,
 *     whatever the registry says or fails to say later, because revocation is
 *     permanent.
 *
 * "Not revoked" answers are kept for OK_MS, so a revocation reaches a receiver
 * that already knows the sender within that. Failed lookups are kept for
 * FAILED_MS so an outage does not add a timeout to every message.
